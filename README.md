# python_jarvis_AI
used WolframAlpha and wikipedia libraries as well as a text to speech library to create a Jarvis

starts up a simple gui where you can type a question, and displays answers from WolframAlpha and wikipedia if they are available (error handelling!) then using pyttsx3, the text is read.

future plans: add speech recognition so you don't have to type your question.
